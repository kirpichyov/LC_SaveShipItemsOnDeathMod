# Save ship items on death v1.0.1
### Saves ship items on crew death but takes half a scrap price fee for saving

This mod requires to be set up on both clients and servers, otherwise, clients will not see the updated prices or will not be able to connect.

### Configuration
You can use the Thunderstore to configure the scrap penalty fee percentage. Configuration files are generated after launching the game, with the mod installed, at least once.

### Future updates
- Add configuration that allows to enable, disable and edit scrap fee amount that will be applied for saved items
- Add configuration that allows to enable, disable and edit credits fee amount

### Known limitation
- If LateCompany mod installed then player who joined after lobby closed in vanilla game then joined player will have no synced items cost after death. Howewer, server will still count price in right way so it's just a display bug. Player could just rejoin and it should work. It's planned to find a workaround for this issue to sync such clients.
